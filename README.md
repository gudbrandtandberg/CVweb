# CVweb
A Web App that uses the ChessVision project

Run 

```python main.py```


The app assumes a host is listening for __POST__ requests on __http://localhost:5000__.
The post should contain exactly one image file in the __FILES__ variable.
The response from this host is either a FEN string containing an extracted chess position, or an error message.
